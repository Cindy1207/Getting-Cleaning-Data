# Getting-Cleaning-Data
Assignment of the Course Cleaning &amp; Getting data

This is the project of the course 'Getting and Cleaning Data'.
In R a script is created called 'run_analysis.R'. The goal is to prepare a tidy dataset. This script does the following. 

1)	
a. Download and unzip the dataset "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip"

b. Load the test and the training datasets with read.csv
 
c. Create one dataset

2) Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

3) Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.

4) Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names.

5) From the data set in step 4, create a second, independent tidy set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


The tidy dataset is called 'tidy_dataset.txt'.

The Codebook summarizes the data fields of 'tidy_dataset.txt'.
