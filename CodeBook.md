# Codebook

This codebook summarizes the data fields of 'tidy_dataset.txt'.

## Background

* Experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years.
* Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING)
wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist.
* Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity
at a constant rate of 50Hz.
* 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% of the volunteers was selected for generating the test data. 


## Identifiers

* `Id` - The ID of the subject (volunteer); Id=[1,30]
* `Activity` - The activity performed when the corresponding measurements were taken


## Activity Labels

* `WALKING`: subject was walking during the test
* `WALKING_UPSTAIRS`: subject was walking upstairs during the test
* `WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS`: subject was walking downstairs during the test
* `SITTING`: subject was sitting during the test
* `STANDING`: subject was standing during the test
* `LAYING`: subject was laying down during the test
